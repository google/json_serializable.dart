_This example assumes you're using a recent version of the Dart or Flutter SDK._

To use [package:json_serializable][json_serializable] in your package, add these
dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  json_annotation: ^4.8.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.3.3
  json_serializable: ^6.6.0
```

Annotate your code with classes defined in
[package:json_annotation][json_annotation].

- See [`lib/example.dart`][example] for an example of a file using these
  annotations.

- See [`lib/example.g.dart`][example_g] for the generated file.

Run `dart run build_runner build` to generate files into your source directory.

```console
> dart pub run build_runner build
[INFO] ensureBuildScript: Generating build script completed, took 368ms
[INFO] BuildDefinition: Reading cached asset graph completed, took 54ms
[INFO] BuildDefinition: Checking for updates since last build completed, took 663ms
[INFO] Build: Running build completed, took 10ms
[INFO] Build: Caching finalized dependency graph completed, took 44ms
[INFO] Build: Succeeded after 4687ms with 1 outputs
```

_NOTE_: If you're using Flutter, replace `dart run` with
`flutter pub run`.
